A Pomodoro Timer made using vanilla JavaScript 

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method where the user breaks down a task into specific intervals, for example, the user may work uninterrupted for twenty-five minutes followed by a five minute rest period away from their desk.

This was a technique I adopted early on in my programming journey to help me learn more efficiently and work more effectively, while also helping me to break up my day into productive segments. 

It occurred to me that creating a pomodoro timer would be a fantastic addition to my portfolio and also help me to learn some key vanilla JavaScript concepts. The design of this app was created with Materialize, this helped me to create a friendly user interface, as Mateterialize uses Googles material design concepts that can be found in many of Google products, allowing me to make many of the features feel familiar to the user. 

Please feel free to take a look through my code to see the inner workings of my Pomodoro App.
